# My own projects
These are all projects that I wrote back in the day in various stages of completion. To save the pain of wading through someone else's projects, I've highlighted any I think may possibly be interesting to others with a 游릭 character.

## Games
- 游릭[Cribbage](https://github.com/rokcoder-bbcmicro/My-BBC-Master-5.25-archive/raw/main/my%20own%20projects/dfs/Cribbage.dsd) - _(Bootable disc) This plays a decent AI game against you - only controls are space and enter_
- 游릭[Dungeons and Dragons](https://github.com/rokcoder-bbcmicro/My-BBC-Master-5.25-archive/raw/main/my%20own%20projects/adfs/Dungeons%20and%20Dragons.adf) - _(Bootable disc) A Dungeons and Dragons project I was working on (inspired by Wizardry on the Apple II). Bits and pieces are done. I was happy with the general labyrinthine display style. Walking through the archway (not the gate) takes you into the actual dungeon. I've always intended to go back and finish this at some point..._
## Utilities
- 游릭[Date Stamp](https://github.com/rokcoder-bbcmicro/My-BBC-Master-5.25-archive/raw/main/my%20own%20projects/adfs/Date%20Stamp.adf) - _(Bootable disc) ROM image (and source) for a utility I wrote that maintains a date stamp for when files are created/updated/etc. Works on DFS as well as ADFS. I found this __extremely__ useful. Everything is done transparently - see timestamps simply by typing *STAMP. I just tested it on DFS for sanity reasons - other than the date showing up as 19A2 it seems fine. Y2K..._
- 游릭[UserPortControl](https://github.com/rokcoder-bbcmicro/My-BBC-Master-5.25-archive/raw/main/my%20own%20projects/dfs/UserPortControl.dsd) - _(Bootable disc) A control language written by me that accompanies a control box that connects to the RS232 (created by my dad). Was used in schools where the children could attach all sorts of sensors, motors, etc to the control board and program them via my language (e.g. if heatSensor=on, turn on fan)_
## Graphical
- [Game of Life project](https://github.com/rokcoder-bbcmicro/My-BBC-Master-5.25-archive/raw/main/my%20own%20projects/adfs/Game%20of%20Life%20project.adf)
  - 2DLife
    - 游릭LifeSlowMC - _Run this with *RUN LifeSlowMC to see the game of life_
    - MkLifeSlow - _The assembly language which creates LifeSlowMC_
  - 3DLife
    - 3DLife - _The Game of Life in 3D - might be wise to set BeebEm to 5x speed!_
    - MakeMC - _The assembly language which creates MC_
    - MC - _The machine code that runs at the heart of 3DLife_
    - GameOfLife - _3DLife in BASIC (I think) but it runs out of memory_
    - A - _Early version of the above maybe?_
    - data* - _No idea!_
## Miscellaneous
- [Birthday Present](https://github.com/rokcoder-bbcmicro/My-BBC-Master-5.25-archive/raw/main/my%20own%20projects/adfs/Birthday%20Present.adf) - _(Bootable disc) A birthday card made for me by some friends when I was at school_
## Various
- [Pool](https://github.com/rokcoder-bbcmicro/My-BBC-Master-5.25-archive/raw/main/my%20own%20projects/adfs/Pool.adf)
  - A - _Pool physics in BASIC (with assembly for drawing balls)_
  - 0 - _Pool physics using assembly for calculations and drawing balls_
  - SetKey0 - _Sets function key 0 to do... something_
  - T-Stamp - _Time stamps for files as set up and used by my TimeStamp utility_
