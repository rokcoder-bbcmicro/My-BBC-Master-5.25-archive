# My BBC Master 5.25" archive
I've finally gotten around to (making a start at) archiving my BBC Master 5.25" floppies!

The archive is contained in a single repository with folders to break the collection down into categories. Each folder contains its own README file (like this one) to give a breakdown of the treasures to be found within!

<big><b><details><summary>ADFS disk images</summary></b></big>
  
Most of my disk images are ADFS as I could store a lot more per disk that way. For those not familiar with ADFS images, it is easily set up in BeebEm
```
Set the machine to being a Master 128 by selecting Hardware / BBC Model / BBC Master 128

To choose ADFS as your filing system you can do any of the following
- *ADFS
- A+BREAK
- *CO.FILE 13 (This is my preference as it sets ADFS as the dafault)

Similarly, to choose DFS you can do any of the following
- *DISC
- D+BREAK
- *CO.FILE 9
```
</details>

<big><b><details><summary>Master 128 incompatibilities</summary></b></big>

There are a small handful of archived games that don't work properly on the BBC Master but are stored on ADFS disk images regardless. Most of these will run but have messed up user-defined characters (because they're stored in a different location on the Master). A few won't run at all.

_This is a work in progress and will no doubt be going on for weeks (if not months) so don't forget to come back!_

Lots of programs that were used in schools
## [Games](https://github.com/rokcoder-bbcmicro/My-BBC-Master-5.25-archive/tree/main/games)
These contain all the collections of games I had. Most of the disks are bootable and use the menu I wrote back in my school days.
## [Media](https://github.com/rokcoder-bbcmicro/My-BBC-Master-5.25-archive/tree/main/media)
A music that runs on a standard BBC, one that requires a Music 500 (which BeebEm emulates extremely well) and a disc full of pictures and animations
## [My own programs](https://github.com/rokcoder-bbcmicro/My-BBC-Master-5.25-archive/tree/main/my%20own%20projects)
Delve into here at your own risk. Lots of utilities, games, demos and more in varying stages of completion!
## [ROMs](https://github.com/rokcoder-bbcmicro/My-BBC-Master-5.25-archive/tree/main/roms)
ROM images for use in sideways RAM (or burning to EPROMs)
## [Utilities](https://github.com/rokcoder-bbcmicro/My-BBC-Master-5.25-archive/tree/main/utilities)
A few disks jam-packed full of utilities for disks, tapes, copying, programming and more
## [Word processors](https://github.com/rokcoder-bbcmicro/My-BBC-Master-5.25-archive/tree/main/word%20processing)
Word processors, desktop publishing and things of that general ilk
