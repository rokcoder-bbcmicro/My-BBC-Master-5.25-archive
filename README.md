# My BBC Master 5.25" archive
I've finally gotten around to (making a start at) archiving my BBC Master 5.25" floppies!

The archive is contained in a single repository with folders to break the collection down into categories. Each folder contains its own README file (like this one) to give a breakdown of the treasures to be found within!

_This is a work in progress and will no doubt be going on for weeks (if not months) so don't forget to come back!_
## Games
These contain all the collections of games I had. Most of the disks are bootable and use the menu I wrote back in my school days.
## Music
A couple of disks - one contains music that runs on a standard BBC and the other requires a Music 500 (which BeebEm emulates extremely well)
## Utilities
A few disks jam-packed full of utilities for disks, tapes, copying, programming and more
