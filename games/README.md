# Game collections
Lots of games packed onto these images (accessed via the menu I wrote as a young lad)

There are one or two games in there that I wrote when I was a young lad (and some games will have had their protections stripped off by me and/or some tape-based or tape-only games will have been transferred from tape to disk by me).

Hopefully I'll go through these disks at some point, remove duplication, ensure everything runs from menus, etc. For now, I just wanted to safely archive everything while my 5.25" floppies are still readable!

*Note: These are the disks I have on ADFS. DFS disks will be added next. I'll then be archiving non-games, my own projects, etc. Any feedback is welcome!*
