# My own projects
These are all projects that I wrote back in the day in various stages of completion

## Games
- Cribbage _- This plays a decent AI game against you - only controls are space and enter_
## Utilities
- UserPortControl - _A control language written by me that accompanies a control box that connects to the RS232 (creatde by my dad). Was used in schools where the children could attach all sorts of sensors, motors, etc to the control board and program them via my language (e.g. if heatSensor=on, turn on fan)_
